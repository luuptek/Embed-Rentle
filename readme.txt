== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it cost something? =

We have two plans **Lite** and **Core**. Lite is always free, and you can use the plugin with it to handle your online rentals. With Core we offer additional benefits and you can check its pricing [here](https://www.rentle.io/pricing)

= Why is Rentle Lite free? =

We believe online rentals are a basic right for every business. We wanted to enable every business to get started with online rentals without a hassle.

= Do you offer support? =

Yes. You can reach us via in-app chat or via email at [support@rentle.io](support@rentle.io).

= Can I use the same system for walk-in rentals? =

Yes, but you will probably need Rentle Core for that. With Core you can handle your whole operation from one system without any hassle like our largest customers. But if you are searching for a solution for online bookings or rentals - check out Lite first. It is fast and easy way to get started.
