== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Twice Commerce cost something? =

We have four plans: FREE, DISCOVER, BUILD, and ADVANCE. The FREE plan doesn’t cost anything. The paid plans start at $19.50/month. Learn more about the Plans [here](https://www.twicecommerce.com/pricing).

= Do I need a credit card to sign up? =

Nope, you can start with Twice Commerce Free, our forever-free plan.

= What is the right plan for me? =

Our general rule is that if you only operate online, you’re good with the FREE or DISCOVER plan. With DISCOVER, you get more customization options and lower payment processing fees.

If you also have a brick-and-mortar store, you will need the BUILD plan to create orders for walk-in customers. The ADVANCE plan is for high-volume merchants that need many features.

= Can I also sell products and services with Twice Commerce? =

Yes, you can. You can make products available for rent or sale and sell services like courses and tours. You can even cross-sell products and services by bundling them into packages.

= Does Twice Commerce offer support? =

Yes. You can always contact us through chat or via [email](mailto:support@twicecommerce.com). We also have an extensive [knowledge base](https://support.twicecommerce.com) where you can find answers to your questions.

= Is Twice Commerce secure? =

Twice Commerce is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant and audited as such annually. Your and your customer's data is secured according to the highest standards.

= Can I use the same system for walk-in rentals? =

Yes. With Twice Commerce, you can seamlessly incorporate online and offline sales without extra operational hassle.
